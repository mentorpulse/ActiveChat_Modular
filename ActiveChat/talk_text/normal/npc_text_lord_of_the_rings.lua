"I saw a dwarf bragging about crafting 'the one hammer to rule them all.' He smashed it on the first swing.",
"Some elf in Darnassus is always mumbling, 'One does not simply walk into Blackrock Depths.'",
"I heard a rumor about a ring that grants invisibility... and debt to goblins.",
"There’s a gnome claiming they’ve found Mount Doom. It’s actually just a hot spring in Winterspring.",
"A wizard told me to 'keep it secret, keep it safe.' I’m pretty sure he just wanted my gold.",
"Have you seen that tree in Ashenvale? It’s walking! Or maybe I just had too much Thunderbrew.",
"Some guy in Stormwind is calling himself 'Ranger of the North.' Pretty sure he just got lost.",
"I saw a hobbit-sized rogue pickpocketing in Ironforge. Maybe it’s time for some 'second breakfast.'",
"That sword reforged by the blacksmith? It broke again... during the tutorial quest.",
"Be careful in Stranglethorn. There’s a spider out there they call 'Shelob.' Big as a house, mean as a troll.",
{"One does not simply walk into Orgrimmar.", "Unless you’re looking for trouble.", "Then it’s more of a sprint."},
{"I hear there’s a ring of great power hidden somewhere.", "And everyone who finds it goes mad.", "Maybe just stick to necklaces."},
{"Why do adventurers always carry so many items?", "Because they think they’re like Frodo.", "But they’re more like Sam, doing all the work."},
{"Ever heard of the Fellowship of the Mug?", "Yeah, it’s just a group of dwarves at the tavern.", "And they’re on an epic quest for ale."},
{"Do you think elves really make the best archers?", "Only if you believe the stories.", "Personally, I think goblins are underrated."},
{"There’s a place where the shadows lie.", "You mean my coin pouch?", "No, I mean the Black Temple. Close enough, though."},
{"Why do adventurers think they can take on an entire army?", "Because they’ve read too many epic sagas.", "Reality hits hard, like a troll’s club."},
{"Have you heard of the nine riders?", "Yeah, they’re just delivery folks on horses.", "Turns out, even legends need to pay the bills."},
{"Why do adventurers love shiny things?", "Because they think every trinket is magical.", "Spoiler: It’s usually not."},
{"The trees are speaking again.", "What are they saying?", "Mostly complaining about adventurers chopping them down."},
{"What’s with all the rings of power?", "Everyone seems to have one these days.", "Maybe they’re running a two-for-one sale."},
{"There’s an orc who thinks he’s the Dark Lord.", "How’s that working out for him?", "He got defeated by a gnome yesterday."},
{"The mountain paths are treacherous.", "Do you think they’re guarded by a balrog?", "No, just by angry goats. Equally dangerous."},
{"Why does every ancient ruin have spiders?", "Because even evil needs pest control.", "And spiders work for free."},
{"Ever wonder why adventurers never travel with a fellowship?", "Because they prefer solo loot.", "And less arguing over who gets the epic sword."},
{"I hear there’s a golden ring hidden in the forest.", "And it’s cursed.", "Sounds like a standard loot drop to me."},
{"Why do elves always look so serious?", "Because they’re living through another age of chaos.", "And they still haven’t found decent coffee."},
{"Why do adventurers think they’re chosen ones?", "Because they found a shiny sword in a cave.", "Turns out, every cave has one."},
{"Ever tried throwing a ring into a volcano?", "No, but I’ve thrown my patience into one.", "Both end with a lot of screaming."},
{"Do you think dwarves really dig too greedily?", "Only if there’s treasure involved.", "Otherwise, they’re just efficient miners."},
{"What’s with all the magical rings lately?", "It’s like every adventurer has one.", "Magic rings: the latest fashion trend."},
{"Why do adventurers think they can talk to eagles?", "Because they’ve seen it in the stories.", "Turns out, eagles don’t care about your quest."},
{"The eye is always watching.", "You mean the eye of the tavern keeper?", "Yeah, especially when you haven’t paid your tab."},
{"Why do adventurers always head to the mountains?", "Because they think treasure is up there.", "Mostly it’s just snow and regret."},
{"The road goes ever on and on.", "Until you hit an invisible wall.", "Or get distracted by side quests."},
