"I overheard an NPC complaining about being clicked on too much. 'I have feelings too!' they said.",
"Why do bosses always wait until you’re ready? It’s like they know we’re on a schedule.",
"I heard a rogue grumbling about their rotation. 'Why is it always backstab? My front needs love too!'",
"Ever wonder why guards are level 120 in a beginner zone? Must be the best job in Azeroth.",
"Saw a mage blink off a cliff and laugh, saying, 'Patch notes didn’t mention fall damage.'",
"An NPC just told me they’re unionizing to demand better quest rewards. About time, right?",
"I saw a druid shapeshift mid-dungeon and scream, 'This isn’t Animal Crossing!'",
"Someone in Stormwind yelled, 'Why does every expansion give us more buttons? My hotbar’s full!'",
"A paladin just told me their bubble is OP because even Blizzard can’t nerf it.",
"I asked a quest NPC for directions, and they said, 'Look, I just stand here. Try the wiki.'",
{"Why does everyone keep asking me about the best build?", "I’m just an NPC, not a strategy guide.", "Maybe I should start charging for advice."},
{"Ever wonder why we NPCs never blink?", "Because the developers didn’t think it was important.", "It’s like we’re trapped in an eternal staring contest."},
{"Why is my dialogue always so repetitive?", "Because players keep clicking on me.", "Seriously, stop it. I’ve only got three lines."},
{"What’s the deal with respawning mobs?", "They’re just as confused as we are.", "Imagine being defeated only to wake up and do it again."},
{"Why are loot drops always so random?", "Because the RNG gods are fickle.", "They love chaos, just like you."},
{"Ever notice how quest givers never help with quests?", "We’re just here to point and wave.", "Besides, someone’s got to stay clean for the cutscenes."},
{"Why is the mailbox always empty?", "Because no one writes letters anymore.", "They’re too busy spamming trade chat."},
{"Ever wonder why vendors buy everything?", "Because we don’t ask questions.", "Even if it’s a broken sword or spoiled meat."},
{"Why can’t I leave this spot?", "Because the devs glued my feet down.", "Apparently, free will isn’t in my programming."},
{"Why does every raid boss have a phase two?", "Because one phase just isn’t dramatic enough.", "What’s next? Phase three: emotional damage?"},
{"Ever think about why mounts disappear indoors?", "It’s not realism, it’s server optimization.", "No one wants a kodo blocking the tavern door."},
{"Why are backpacks so small?", "Because if they were bigger, you’d hoard even more junk.", "And we NPCs would have to listen to you complain about it."},
{"Why do mobs drop gold?", "Because it’s the only way to explain your endless riches.", "Apparently, wolves are natural investors."},
{"What’s with all the random locked doors?", "They’re just there to frustrate you.", "And make rogues feel useful."},
{"Why do raid bosses always yell their mechanics?", "Because subtlety isn’t epic.", "And voice acting budgets aren’t cheap."},
{"Ever wonder why you can never sit on chairs?", "Because they’re decorative, not functional.", "Comfort is overrated in a fantasy world."},
{"Why do vendors never run out of stock?", "Because magic, obviously.", "Either that or a very efficient supply chain."},
{"Why do quest chains always end with killing something?", "Because it’s more exciting than delivering a package.", "Though honestly, I’d prefer the package."},
{"What’s the deal with NPC pathing?", "It’s like we’re following invisible rails.", "And tripping over every pebble along the way."},
{"Why do critters have more health than logic suggests?", "Because players would one-shot them otherwise.", "Critters deserve a chance to dodge too."},
{"Why do we always ask for boar livers?", "Because no one wants to collect goblin toenails.", "Or maybe it’s just easier to animate boars."},
{"Why do mounts vanish when dismounted?", "Because they’re not real, just like your social life.", "Kidding! Or am I?"},
{"Why do repair costs exist?", "Because realism, apparently.", "But not realistic enough to include shoe-tying mechanics."},
{"Ever wonder why the sky never changes?", "Because dynamic weather is expensive.", "And no one wants to raid during a storm."},
{"Why can’t we NPCs have mounts?", "Because then we’d escape.", "And who would hand out quests then?"},
