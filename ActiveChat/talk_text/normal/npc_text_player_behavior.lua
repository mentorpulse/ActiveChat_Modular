"Why do players stand AFK on the auction house steps? Are they hoping for tips or just showing off their gear?",
"I saw someone AFK in Stormwind with their mount parked right in the fountain. Classy.",
"Why does every player with a flashy mount have to jump in circles at the mailbox?",
"There’s a guy in Orgrimmar who’s been AFK for so long, the NPCs started calling him a statue.",
"I saw someone trying to fit their mammoth mount into the bank. Spoiler: it didn’t work.",
"Why do players always summon the loudest mounts in the quietest places? Is it a flex or just bad manners?",
"Ever notice the same few players AFK in the same spot every day? It’s like they’re staking a claim.",

"Why do players with legendary weapons always find the busiest spot to unsheath them repeatedly?",
    "Why do players always jump nonstop while waiting for a dungeon queue? Are they training for some kind of marathon?",

"Why do players always use fireworks in crowded areas? The only thing they’re celebrating is lag.",
"Someone in Stormwind was fishing in the canals... using a spear. Bold strategy.",
"Why do players always duel right outside the city gates? It’s like the unofficial arena.",
"I saw a player with a mammoth mount stuck in the auction house doorway. Traffic jam, Azeroth style.",
"Why do players park their dragons on quest NPCs? It’s like they want to be unhelpful on purpose.",
"Someone just summoned a train set in the middle of a raid group. Instant chaos.",
"Ever notice players only use toys like the orb of deception when there’s an audience? Gotta show off.",
"I saw a rogue stealthing around a city. Who are they sneaking up on, NPCs?",
"Why do players spam spells in town? Practicing their rotation, or just showing off their keybinds?",
"Someone just jumped off a cliff with a glider and shouted, 'For science!' Bold move.",
"I saw a druid in travel form stuck in a narrow alley. Guess even cats can’t always land on their feet.",
"Why do players always try to climb to the highest point in the city? Must be for the view... or the screenshots.",

{"Ever notice players never read quest descriptions?", "They just click through and ask, 'What do I do?'", "It’s like we write this stuff for fun."},

{"Have you seen how players name their pets?", "I saw one named 'Dinner' the other day.", "And another named 'Tax Deduction.'"},
{"Why do they always duel in front of the bank?", "Because nothing says ‘serious fight’ like bystanders.", "Or maybe they’re just showing off their gear."},
{"Why do adventurers always stand on top of NPCs?", "I guess it makes us easier to click.", "But it’s not great for personal space."},
{"Why do they always run around in circles?", "Maybe it helps them think.", "Or maybe they’re just bored."},
{"Players love to jump off cliffs.", "Yeah, then they complain about dying.", "Gravity always wins, folks."},

{"Have you noticed adventurers love to stack on top of each other?", "Yeah, like they’re forming a totem pole.", "Or trying to summon a boss."},
{"Why do they always roll need on everything?", "Because greed is boring, apparently.", "And then they say, 'Oops, misclick!'"},
{"Why do adventurers always jump during boss fights?", "They think it dodges mechanics.", "Spoiler: It doesn’t."},
{"Why do players spam the same joke in chat?", "They think it’s funny the 100th time.", "Newsflash: It’s not."},
