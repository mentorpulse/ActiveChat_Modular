-- Guild chat text additions with "Lord of the Rings" theme
{"Our guild leader is calling themselves 'The Fellowship.' What’s next, a ring to throw into a volcano?", "Careful, or we’ll all be Frodo by tomorrow.", "Dibs on being Legolas!", "Fine, I’ll be the dwarf. Pass the ale."},
{"Who brought the giant eagles to the raid?", "They were supposed to be a surprise escape plan!", "Too bad they don’t do damage.", "Next time, we ride them straight to the boss."},
{"The guild bank feels like Gollum’s lair. Who’s hoarding all the shiny loot?", "My precious... repair gold.", "I swear, Carl’s worse than Sméagol.", "Carl! Stop hiding epic gems in the junk tab!"},
{"Anyone else notice the raid leader keeps yelling, 'You shall not pass!' during boss fights?", "It’s motivating... kind of.", "I just wish they’d stop doing it on trash pulls.", "Gandalf would be proud."},
{"Why does our tank keep calling himself Aragorn?", "Because he keeps pulling aggro, like a true king.", "I think he just likes the cape.", "Aragorn or not, he still dies to fire."},
{"We’re forming the Fellowship of the Guild tonight. Who’s bringing snacks?", "Does lembas bread count?", "Not if it tastes like cardboard.", "Fine, I’ll bring the ale."},
{"Who’s been sending carrier pigeons instead of using whispers?", "We’re reenacting Middle-earth traditions, obviously.", "Next raid: smoke signals and ancient runes.", "This guild is one pipeweed away from a Tolkien novel."},

{"Who’s the guy in the back muttering about 'one ring to rule them all'?", "Probably the warlock. They’re always dramatic.", "Do you think it’s soulbound?", "Knowing warlocks, it’s cursed too."},
{"Why do we keep taking detours during dungeon runs?", "Because someone thinks we’re on an 'epic journey.'", "We’re not Frodo, this isn’t Mount Doom.", "Next time, I’m bringing a map."},
{"Why does the guild leader keep calling us 'Hobbits'?", "Because we’re small but mighty.", "And we eat second breakfast before every raid.", "Someone pass the lembas bread."},
{"The rogue insists they’re the 'One Rogue to Rule Them All.'", "But they keep rolling need on everything!", "Even on items they can’t use.", "At least Gollum didn’t need stealth."},
{"Who’s been naming mounts after the Nazgûl?", "Probably the hunter. They’re obsessed with black steeds.", "That explains the eerie howling.", "Maybe leave the ring at home next time."},
{"Why does the mage keep calling their fire spells 'Balrog Mode'?", "Because it sounds cooler than 'I forgot to sheep.'", "Too bad they can’t cast wings.", "They’d make a great budget Gandalf."},
{"The tank started wearing a helmet and calling it 'The Crown of Gondor.'", "What’s next, reforging the guild tabard?", "As long as they don’t try to duel Smaug.", "We’d wipe before the first AoE."},
{"The druid is calling their tree form 'Ent Mode.'", "Isn’t that just another way of saying they’re AFK?", "Pretty sure they’re 'rooted' in place.", "Fine, let’s just call them Treebeard."},
{"Who keeps singing elven songs in guild chat?", "It’s the bard. Again.", "Their lyrics are... creative.", "Creative or cursed?"},
{"The guild feast includes mushrooms now.", "Because the rogue insists it’s 'authentic Shire cuisine.'", "Too bad they forgot the ale.", "No ale, no party."},
{"The warlock built a flaming portal and called it 'Mount Doom.'", "Do we really trust them with fire magic?", "Only if they stop summoning imps during boss fights.", "One does not simply portal into Mount Doom."},
{"Who renamed the guild ranks after the Fellowship?", "The leader did. They’re Gandalf, obviously.", "Does that make the tank Boromir?", "Only if they die first."},
{"The hunter is naming all their pets after dwarves.", "Do they have a Gimli yet?", "No, but they’ve got a Bombur.", "Let’s just hope the pets don’t demand treasure."},
{"Why is the guild hall filled with candles?", "The priest says it’s 'elven ambiance.'", "More like a fire hazard.", "At least it’s better than the warlock’s décor."},
{"Someone keeps calling guild events 'quests of great importance.'", "It’s just fishing night.", "But it sounds cooler, doesn’t it?", "Next week: the epic gathering of herbs."},
{"The rogue claims they can find the secret door to Erebor.", "Too bad they can’t find their way out of a dungeon.", "Maybe the real treasure is their sense of direction.", "Spoiler: it’s not."},
{"Who keeps trying to forge legendary items?", "It’s the blacksmith. They’re calling it 'The Hammer of the West.'", "Meanwhile, they’re just repairing shields.", "Legendary creativity, at least."},
{"Why does the guild leader call the raid 'The Battle of Helm’s Deep'?", "Because it makes us feel important.", "Too bad we wiped on trash mobs.", "Guess we’ll call it 'Helm’s Derp' now."},
{"The healer insists their staff is 'Elven-crafted.'", "Pretty sure it’s from a low-level quest.", "But they wave it like it’s Andúril.", "At least it glows."},
{"Why is the guild tabard suddenly gold and black?", "The leader says it represents Mordor.", "But nobody wants to be the Eye of Sauron.", "Next time, let’s vote on the design."},
{"The mage just renamed their spells after Elvish words.", "Does anyone know what 'Naur' means?", "Pretty sure it means fire.", "Great. Now I’m learning lore just to follow chat."},
{"Who suggested a guild road trip to Mount Hyjal?", "The druid. They said it’s 'Middle-earth adjacent.'", "Pretty sure that’s a stretch.", "At least it’s scenic."},
{"The guild leader said we’re all part of a prophecy.", "Does the prophecy include loot drops?", "No, just 'peril and glory.'", "Typical leadership drama."},
{"Why does the rogue keep shouting 'For Frodo!'?", "Because they think it makes them heroic.", "Too bad they died five seconds later.", "At least it was dramatic."},
{"The warlock renamed their demon 'Smaug.'", "Does it breathe fire?", "No, but it steals gold.", "Fits the theme, I guess."},
{"Why is the raid leader carrying a torch everywhere?", "They’re calling it 'The Light of Eärendil.'", "It’s just a regular torch.", "But hey, it’s glowing."},
