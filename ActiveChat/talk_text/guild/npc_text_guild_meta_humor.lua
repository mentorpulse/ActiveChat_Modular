{"Why does our raid leader keep yelling, 'This isn’t a speedrun!'?", "Probably because we keep pulling before the healer’s ready.", "Speedrunning: the art of wiping faster.", "New guild motto: ‘Slow is smooth, smooth is survival.’"},
{"Who keeps yelling, 'Alt-F4 for free loot' in trade chat?", "Probably the same person who types '/dance' for better DPS.", "Classic troll move.", "Someone fell for it? Oh, bless their newbie heart."},
{"Why does the healer always go AFK when we wipe?", "It’s their ‘union-mandated break.’", "Or they’re writing their 'Wipes I Have Known' memoir.", "Next wipe, we AFK with them."},
{"Our mage just said, 'I’m only here for the parsing.'", "Do they even know what the boss looks like?", "Parsing: where spreadsheets meet flame strikes.", "Next time, we’re parsing patience."},
{"I swear, our tank reads patch notes like they’re holy scripture.", "Meanwhile, I didn’t even know there was a patch.", "Patch notes: the nerf-filled bedtime story.", "Let’s just hope they didn’t nerf snacks."},
{"Guild notice: Stop telling new players, 'The harder the dungeon, the rarer the mount drop.'", "But it’s funny!", "It’s cruel... and also hilarious.", "Fine, but only if they’re Alliance."},

{"Someone asked if we’re doing Mythic raids next patch.", "We’re still wiping on Heroic trash, so probably not.", "Mythic: where bosses get smarter and players don’t.", "Let’s focus on surviving Patch Day first."},
{"Why do we keep pulling bosses 'accidentally'?", "Because our tank thinks 'charge' means 'yolo.'", "It’s either bravery or poor judgment.", "Probably both."},
{"The guild leader just said, 'We’re a family, not a dictatorship.'", "Then why do they take all the good loot?", "Families share, dictators distribute.", "Apparently, we’re both."},
{"Who keeps using the guild hall for roleplaying?", "Probably the bard. Again.", "It’s not an inn, it’s a war room!", "Tell that to the gnome in full costume."},
{"Someone suggested a guild-only trivia night.", "Does it include lore questions?", "Of course. Who else remembers Thrall’s middle name?", "Trivia nights: where friendships are tested."},
{"The healer keeps saying, 'Mana is a social construct.'", "Until they’re out of it during the boss fight.", "Then it’s ‘OOM is life.’", "Maybe they’re just testing our patience."},
{"Why is the guild tabard always changing colors?", "Because the guild leader thinks it’s 'fashion-forward.'", "Last week, it was neon green.", "We’re more 'fashion-confused' than forward."},
{"Who keeps asking for raid invites 10 minutes late?", "It’s always the rogue. Classic.", "They’re ‘fashionably late,’ just like their stealth cooldown.", "Next time, we lock the door."},
{"Why do we wipe during the same mechanic every time?", "Because reading tooltips is overrated.", "And listening to the raid leader is optional.", "Mechanics are just boss suggestions, right?"},
{"The guild bank has a new tab labeled 'Emergency Fund.'", "Who’s it for?", "Probably the guild leader’s mount collection.", "It’s less 'emergency' and more 'shopping spree.'"},
{"Why does every guild meeting turn into a loot argument?", "Because everyone thinks they’re the main character.", "Newsflash: Nobody’s the protagonist.", "Except maybe the guild cat."},
{"Someone renamed the raid group 'Wipe Club.'", "Is the first rule not to talk about it?", "The first rule is to bring extra repair money.", "The second rule is to blame the hunter."},
{"The raid leader keeps saying, 'This time, we’ve got it!'", "Do we ever actually get it?", "Only if ‘it’ means a repair bill.", "At least optimism is free."},
{"Why does the guild bard keep writing songs about our wipes?", "Because misery loves musical company.", "Last week’s hit was called 'The Ballad of Standing in Fire.'", "It’s too relatable."},
{"Who keeps sending fake invites to 'exclusive' guild events?", "It’s the warlock. They’re trolling again.", "Last time, they summoned everyone to a lava pit.", "At least it was memorable."},
{"The guild mage insists they ‘carry the group.’", "Do they?", "Only if you count conjured food as carrying.", "Next time, we’re carrying them to a library."},
{"Why do we always farm the wrong boss?", "Because nobody reads the loot table.", "We’re farming regrets, not gear.", "At least regrets are tradable."},
{"The tank just macro’d 'Pull Everything' to their hotkey.", "Is that efficient or terrifying?", "Both. Mostly terrifying.", "The healer’s already writing their resignation letter."},
{"Someone asked if we’re going for world-first kills.", "We’re still going for first-try kills.", "World-first is ambitious for a guild like us.", "Let’s focus on surviving trash mobs first."},
{"Who renamed the guild ranks to meme titles?", "The rogue, obviously.", "Now we’re all ‘Peons’ except the guild leader.", "At least the names are accurate."},
{"Why does the raid leader always forget their own mechanics?", "Because yelling at us is their main cooldown.", "Mechanics are easier to dodge than leadership complaints.", "Let’s just hope the boss forgets too."},
{"The guild keeps talking about 'guild synergy.'", "What does that even mean?", "Probably just another way to say 'stop trolling.'", "Synergy: teamwork disguised as frustration."},
{"Who keeps spamming guild chat with crafting ads?", "The priest trying to sell potions.", "Too bad they’re all labeled ‘experimental.’", "I’m not drinking that."},
{"Why is the guild warlock always AFK during trash pulls?", "Because they’re ‘mentally preparing for the boss.’", "Translation: They’re watching YouTube.", "We’ll call it research."},
